<p>I've picked up some interesting tidbits of info or inspiration along the way as I was researching, designing and building <em>Booker</em>, listed here, in no particular order.</p>

<ul>
{% for credit in site.data.credits %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ credit.url }}" target="_blank">{{ credit.name }}</a>:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>{{ credit.desc }}</em>
        </li>
    </ul>   
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
