<h2 class="section-heading">Hi!</h2>

<p>My name is Ronan and I'm IT architect &amp; consultant by trade, living &amp; working in <a href="http://dublin.ie" target="_blank">Dublin</a>, Ireland. I've worked in various industries in my career to date, from local &amp; central government, financial services including general &amp; life insurance, retail banking &amp; pensions, and aviation and marketing tech, across Ireland, the UK, Europe, North America &amp; the the Middle East.</p>

<p>While I've worked with lots of different technology stacks and platforms, I'm most at home with Java/JEE and a big fan of <a href="http://spring.io" target="_blank">Spring</a>, which forms the basis of the <em>Booker</em> project. I've been using Spring since version 1.2.6 (from 2006 <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and have had the opportunity to use most projects from the Spring portfolio in my professional career. I even tried Spring.NET, anyone remember that?</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Past projects</h2>
<p>Here's some examples of where I've used the Spring portfolio of products over the past 11 years. In each of these I was either lead developer/architect or consulting on technology selection.

<ul>
{% for project in site.data.projects %}
  <li>
  	{{ project.name }}:
  	<ul>
  		<li>
  			<em>{{ project.tech }}</em>
  		</li>
  	</ul>	
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
